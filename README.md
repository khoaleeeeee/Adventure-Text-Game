This is my final project in my Java class at Mission College.
Year: 2018
Language: Java.

You are an adventurer, and your quest is to find and defeat the evil dragon. 
To play the game, select the options to perform your actions. Each option leads to different events and consequences. 
This game is programmed logically, not by an AI. 
Enjoy and explore by yourself.
